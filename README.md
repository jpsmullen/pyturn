# ‚ôªÔ∏è pyturn

**pyturn** is a script for checking if a drink container's barcode is registered
with the [Re-turn](https://re-turn.ie/) scheme. It is essentially an unofficial
command-line interface for the
[barcode checker on the Re-turn website](https://re-turn.ie/consumer/#barcodeChecker),
with optional functionality for reading barcodes from a file, and saving
returnable barcodes to a separate file.

The Re-turn scheme is Ireland's
[deposit-return scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container-deposit_legislation),
launched in February 2024 to reduce littering and increase recycling rates for
plastic bottles and aluminium cans. Between February and June 2024, there was a
transition period, whereby retailers could still sell old drink containers that
didn't have the Re-turn logo on them. Customers were still charged a deposit for
these products, although some of them were eligible to be returned, as their
barcodes were registered with the scheme. This isn't a problem anymore, since
all drink containers sold in Ireland now have the Re-turn logo on them.

This script is almost entirely useless by now, but it still works, and will
likely continue to work for as long as Re-turn have the barcode checker on their
website.
